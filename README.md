# TaiClone
Taiko-like rhythm game, made in Godot.

In very early development, but ready to test! Want to know where TaiClone is headed? Check out the [Trello!](https://trello.com/b/kDb8ZxHf/taiclone)

The game only loads **.osu files** currently! Paste the raw file location in the bottom right and press "Load" to load the chart.

If you save your keybinds in the settings, it will make a config.ini file at the same directory as the game's executible.
