# TaiClone
Taiko-like rhythm game, made in Godot.

In very early development, but ready to test! Want to know where TaiClone is headed? Check out the [Trello](https://trello.com/b/kDb8ZxHf/taiclone)!

The game only loads **.osu files** currently! There's two ways to load files.
- Drag and drop the .osu file into the game window.

- Paste the raw file location (including the name of the file and the extension!) in the bottom left, and press "Load" to load the chart.
